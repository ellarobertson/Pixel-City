# Pixel-City

Presents users with a collection of photos that have been uploaded around them.

Utilizes Apple's MapKit and Flickr's API in order to retrieve users's location and find photos that have been uploaded around the area they select. When pressing a location, users are presented with a collection view of photos that they can then click on to fully view (or use 3D touch to preview)

(from left to right):
1.) Screen upon opening application

2.) Pin is dropped, and previews of photos uploaded within a certain radius appear

3.) View after preview of photo is clicked on
